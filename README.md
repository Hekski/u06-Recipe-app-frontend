# U06 Recipe App - Frontend

School Assignment @ Chas Academy, spring 2022. This is the front end part of it. The assignment was to create a rudamentary recipe app that fetches recipes from an external API and that is also connected to a Laravel backend API that stores recipes in user lists on a database.

Project needs refinements:
  - View button from user lists not working
  - Messeges and alerts from backend needs work
  - Deployment
  - Numbers button on frontpage is not working
  - This readMe and documentation
  - Probably other stuff...

## Getting started

Clone repo and run:

## API

I'm using [Spoonacular's API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api/).

## Requirements

- [x] Be able to get a list of recipe suggestions
- [x] Be able to filter the suggestions of recipes by dish type and allergens/preferences:
  - [x] Starter, main course or dessert (minimum, more dish types may be implemented)
  - [x] Allergens/dietary preferences (eg gluten, nuts, vegetarian, etc.), at least three additional filters must be included in addition to starter, main course and dessert
- [x] Be able to click on a recipe to see its information (with its own route)
- [x] Be able to save recipes in a list (in a database throug a backend API)
- [x] Be able to view saved recipes (with its own route)
- [x] Be able to delete saved recipes from the list
- [x] Frontend must be implemented in the Angular framework
- [x] Use an external API to retrieve recipe information which is displayed in the application
- [x] Must work on a mobile device, ie the above goals must also be possible to perform on a mobile device

---------------

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
